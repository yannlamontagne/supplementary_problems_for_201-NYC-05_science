Let $A$ be an $\nbyn{r}$ matrix and suppose there are $r-1$ rows
(columns) such that all rows (columns) are linear combinations of these $r-1$
rows (columns). Show $\detop\left( A\right) =0.$ 
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
If the determinant is nonzero, then it will remain nonzero with row operations applied to the matrix.
However, by assumption, you can obtain a row of zeros by doing row
operations. Thus the determinant must have been zero.
