Which of these subsets of the vector space of \( \nbyn{2} \) matrices
    are subspaces under the inherited operations? Justify.
\Question \( \set{\begin{mat}
                      a  &0  \\
                      0  &b
                    \end{mat}  \suchthat a,b\in\Re}  \)
\Question \( \set{\begin{mat}
                      a  &0  \\
                      0  &b
                    \end{mat}  \suchthat a+b=0} \)
\Question \( \set{\begin{mat}

                      0  &b

                      0  &b

\begin{Answer}
\Question Yes, we can easily check that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication.
\Question Yes, we can easily check that it is closed under addition and scalar multiplication. 
\Question No.
          It is not closed under addition.
          For instance, 
          \begin{equation*}
            \begin{mat}[r]
              5  &0  \\
              0  &0
            \end{mat}
            +\begin{mat}[r]
              5  &0  \\
              0  &0
            \end{mat}
            =\begin{mat}[r]
              10  &0  \\
              0  &0
            \end{mat}
          \end{equation*}
          is not in the set.
          (This set is also not closed under scalar multiplication,
          for instance, it does not contain the zero matrix.)
