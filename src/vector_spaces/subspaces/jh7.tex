\begin{Exercise}[

The solution set of a homogeneous linear system is a subspace of $\Re^n$ where
the system has $n$ variables.
What about a non-homogeneous linear system; do its solutions form a 
subspace (under the inherited operations)?

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
No, such a set is not closed.
For one thing, it does not contain the zero vector.
