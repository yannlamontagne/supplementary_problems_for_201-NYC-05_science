\begin{Exercise}[

    Is the relation `is a subspace of' transitive?
    That is, if $V$ is a subspace of $W$ and $W$ is a subspace of
    $X$, must $V$ be a subspace of $X$? 
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
      It is transitive;
      apply the subspace test.
      (You must consider the following.
      Suppose \( B \) is a subspace of a vector space \( V \) and suppose
      \( A\subseteq B\subseteq V \) is a subspace.
      From which space does \( A \) inherit its operations?
      The answer is that it doesn't matter \( A \) will inherit the
      same operations in either case.)
