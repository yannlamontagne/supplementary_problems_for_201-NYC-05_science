Is the following a subspace under the inherited natural operations: 
the real-valued
functions of one real variable that are differentiable?
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
Yes.
A theorem of first semester calculus says that a sum of differentiable
functions is differentiable and that
\( (f+g)^\prime=f^\prime+g^\prime \), and that 
a multiple of a differentiable
function is differentiable and that \( (r\cdot f)^\prime=r\,f^\prime \). 


\end{Answer}
