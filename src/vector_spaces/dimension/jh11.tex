\begin{Exercise}[

difficulty=0,
origin={\cite{JH}}]
   Show that
    \( \sequence{\vec{\alpha}_1,\vec{\alpha}_2,\vec{\alpha}_3}\subset\Re^3 \)
    is a basis if and only if there is no plane through the origin containing
    all three vectors.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
     A plane has the
      form $\set{\vec{p}+t_1\vec{v}_1+t_2\vec{v}_2\suchthat t_1,t_2\in\Re}$.
      When the plane passes through the origin we can take the particular
      vector $\vec{p}$ to be $\zero$.
      Thus, in the language we have developed in this chapter, a plane through
      the origin is the span of a set of two vectors.

      Now for the statement.
      Asserting that the three are not coplanar is the same as asserting that
      no vector lies in the span of the other two no vector is a linear
      combination of the other two.
      That's simply an assertion that the three-element set is linearly
      independent.
      Since $\dim(\Re^3)=3$ then the set spans $\Re^3$. The set is a basis for $\Re^3$
