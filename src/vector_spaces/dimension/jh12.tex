\Question Prove that any subspace of a finite dimensional space
        has a basis. 
\Question Prove that any subspace of a finite dimensional space is 
        finite dimensional.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
      Let the space $V$ be finite dimensional.
      Let $S$ be a subspace of $V$.
      \Question The empty set is a linearly independent subset of $S$.
          It can be expanded to a basis
          for the vector space $S$. 
      \Question Any basis for the subspace $S$ is a linearly independent 
          set in the superspace $V$.
          Hence it can be expanded to a basis for the superspace, which is
          finite dimensional.
          Therefore it has only finitely many members.
