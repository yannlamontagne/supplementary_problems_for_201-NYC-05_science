    Assume \( U \) and \( W \) are both subspaces of some vector space, and
    that \( U\subseteq W \).
    \Question Prove that \( \dim (U)\leq\dim (W) \).
    \Question Prove that equality of dimension holds
        if and only if \( U=W \).
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
    \Question A basis for \( U \) is a linearly independent set
            in \( W \)
            and so can be expanded to a basis for \( W \).
            The second basis has at least as many members as the first.
    \Question One direction is clear:~if \( V=W \) then they have the 
            same dimension.
            For the converse, let \( B_U \) be a basis for \( U \).
            It is a linearly independent subset of \( W \) and so can be
            expanded to a basis for \( W \).
            If \( \dim(U)=\dim(W) \) then this basis for \( W \) has no more
            members than does \( B_U \) and so equals \( B_U \).
            Since \( U \) and \( W \) have the same bases, they are equal.
