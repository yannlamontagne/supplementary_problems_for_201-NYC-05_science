Let $V=\set{A \suchthat A \in\matspace_{\nbyn{2}} \text{ and } \detop(A)\neq 0 }$
with the following operations:
\[
A+B=AB \text{ and } kA=kA
\]
\textit{That is, vector addition is matrix multiplication and scalar multiplication is the regular scalar multiplication.}
\Question Does $V$ satisfy closure under vector addition? Justify.
\Question Does $V$ contain a zero vector? If so find it.  Justify.
\Question Does $V$ contains an additive inverse for all of its vectors? Justify.
\Question Does $V$ satisfy closure under scalar multiplication? Justify.

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question Closed under vector addition.  Hint: Apply determinant properties.
\Question 
$\vec{0}
=\begin{mat}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{mat}\in V$
\Question Every $A\in V$ has an additive inverse $A^{-1}$.
% \Question Yes.
\Question Not closed under scalar multiplication. Since 
$0\vec{0}=
0\begin{mat}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{mat}=
\begin{mat}
0 & 0\\
0 & 0
\end{mat}\not\in V$
\end{Answer}
