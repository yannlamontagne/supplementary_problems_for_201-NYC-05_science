\Question Is
         the intersection of linearly independent sets independent?
         Must it be?
\Question How does linear independence relate to complementation?
\Question Show that the union of two linearly independent sets
          can be linearly independent.
\Question Show that
          the union of two linearly independent sets need not be
          linearly independent.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question The intersection of two linearly independent sets
          $S\intersection T$ must be linearly
          independent as it is a subset of the linearly independent set $S$
          (as well as the linearly independent set $T$ also, of course).
\Question The complement of a linearly independent set is linearly
          dependent as it contains the zero vector.
\Question A simple example in \( \Re^2 \) is these two sets.
          \begin{equation*}
            S=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}}
            \qquad
            T=\set{\colvec{0 \\ 1}}          
          \end{equation*}
          A somewhat subtler example, again in \( \Re^2 \), is these two.
          \begin{equation*}
            S=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}}
            \qquad
            T=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}, \colvec{0 \\ 1}}
          \end{equation*}
\Question We must produce an example.
          One, in \( \Re^2 \), is
          \begin{equation*}
            S=\set{\colvec{1 \\ 0}}
            \qquad
            T=\set{\colvec{2 \\ 0}}
          \end{equation*}
          since the linear dependence of \( S_1\union S_2 \) is easy to see.

\end{Answer}
