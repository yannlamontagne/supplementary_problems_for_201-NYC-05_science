Show that the product of two upper triangular matrices is upper triangular.
Does this also hold for lower triangular matrices?
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}
      A matrix is upper triangular if and only if its $i,j$ entry is zero 
      whenever \( i>j \).
      Thus, if \( G,H \) are upper triangular then \( h_{i,j} \) and
      \( g_{i,j} \) are zero when \( i>j \).
      An entry in the product
      \( p_{i,j}=g_{i,1}h_{1,j}+\dots+g_{i,n}h_{n,j} \)
      is zero unless at least some of the terms are nonzero, that is, unless
      for at least some of the summands
      \( g_{i,r}h_{r,j} \) both \( i\leq r \) and \( r\leq j \).
      Of course, if \( i>j \) this cannot happen and so the product of two
      upper triangular matrices is upper triangular.
      (A similar argument works for lower triangular matrices.)
