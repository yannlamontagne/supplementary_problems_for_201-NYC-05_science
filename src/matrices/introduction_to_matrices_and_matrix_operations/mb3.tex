Consider the matrices
$$
A = 
\begin{mat}
  3 & 0 \\
  -1 & 2 \\
  1  & 1
\end{mat}, \; B=
\begin{mat}
  1 & 4 & 2\\
  3 & 1 & 5
\end{mat} \text{ and }  C=
\begin{mat}
  4 & -1 \\
  0 & 2 \\
\end{mat}
$$
Suppose also that the matrices $D$ and $E$ have the following sizes: 
$D$ is $\nbym{2}{4}$  and $E$ is $\nbym{4}{3}$.

Determine whether the given matrix expression is defined. For those that are defined, give the size of the resulting matrix. 
\begin{multicols}{3}
\Question $EB$ 
\Question $(2AC+B^T)^T$ 
\Question $B^2$
\Question $CDE$
\EndCurrentQuestion
\end{multicols}

\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question The product is undefined as the number of columns of $E$ is $3$ and not equal to the number of rows of $B$ which is $2$.
\Question The expression is defined and the resulting matrix is $\nbym{2}{3}$.
\Question The expression is undefined as $B$ is not square.
\Question The expression is defined and the resulting matrix is $\nbym{2}{3}$.
\end{Answer}
