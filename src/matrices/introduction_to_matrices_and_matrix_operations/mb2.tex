Prove that if the product $CAC^T$ is well-defined, then the matrix $A$ must be a square matrix.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
Let's denote by $m \times n$ the size of the matrix $C$, and by $p \times q$ the size of the matrix $A$. Since the product $CA$ is defined, $p$ must be equal to $n$. Since the product $AC^T$ is defined, and $C^T$ is $n \times m$, $q$ must be equal to $n$. As both $p$ and $q$ must be equal to $n$, $A$ is a square matrix (of size $n \times n$).

\end{Answer}
