Prove that for any square~$H$,
        the matrix \( H+\trans{H} \) is symmetric.
        Do every symmetric matrix have this form?
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
For \( H+\trans{H} \), the \( i,j \) entry 
          is \( h_{i,j}+h_{j,i} \) and
          the \( j,i \) entry of  is \( h_{j,i}+h_{i,j} \).
          The two are equal and thus \( H+\trans{H} \) is symmetric.

          Every symmetric matrix does have that form, since we can write
          \( H=(1/2)\cdot(H+\trans{H}) \).
\end{Answer}
