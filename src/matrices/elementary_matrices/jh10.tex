    Prove that any matrix row-equivalent to an invertible matrix is also
    invertible.
\end{Exercise}
\begin{Answer}
      Assume that $B$ is row equivalent to $A$ and that $A$ is invertible.
      Because they are row-equivalent, there is a sequence of elementary row 
operations  
      to reduce one to the other.
      We can do that reduction with elementary matrices, for instance, $A$ can 
      change by row operations to $B$ as $B=E_n\cdots E_1A$.
      This equation gives $B$ as a product of elementary which are invertible matrices then, $B$ is also invertible.
