If matrices $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent then it can be denoted as $A\cong B$. Show that
\Question $A\cong A$
\Question If $A\cong B$, then $B\cong A$.
\Question If $A\cong B$ and $B\cong C$, then $A\cong C$.
\end{Exercise}

\begin{Answer}
\Question $A$ is obtained from $A$ by performing no elementary row operation on $A$.
\Question If $B$ is obtained from $A$ by performing $k$ elementary row operations then $A$ is 
obtained from $B$ by performing the $k$ inverse elementary row operations.
\Question If $B$ is obtained from $A$ by performing $k$ elementary row operations and $C$ is obtained from $B$ by performing $l$ elementary row operations then $C$ is obtained from $A$ by performing the $k+l$ elementary row operations.
\end{Answer}
